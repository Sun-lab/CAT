This folder contains code to process Heiser_2023 data from [paper](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)01222-9). This is a relatively small dataset (~15000 cells) so we leave the entire pipeline in ``cell_type_all4_tcell.ipynb`` notebook. We predict cell types (CD4/CD8) and select cancer reactive cells.

The data can be downloaded from [here](https://osf.io/hftq2/files/osfstorage).
